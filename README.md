First Release #1.0
FiveM Ready Noclip Script
This is my first ever script :3

## Quick Setup ##

Download the file
put in on your resources folder
start "BetterNoclipBySalgado" on server.cfg

## How to use it ##
After having group permissions type on chat:
"/n0" - Level 0 > the slowest one
"/n1" - Level 1
"/n2" - Level 2
"/n3" - Level 3
"/n4" - Level 4
"/n5" - Level 5 > the fastest one
In the future I want to make it change the velocity by only pressing a key instead of a new command.

Feel free to edit it :)
If you have any questions send me a D.M on discord 'Jo√£oPedroSalgado#1337
